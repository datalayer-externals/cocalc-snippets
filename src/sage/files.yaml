title: Saving/Loading Sage Objects
descr: |
    Save objects in Sage to the filesystem.
code: |
    E = EllipticCurve([0,1])
    save(E,"/tmp/file") # A copy of "E" is now saved at /tmp/file.sobj
    E = load("/tmp/file")
    print E

title: "Read CSV data"
descr: |
  We use [Python's `csv` module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html) to read in a CSV file.

  Note that each row is an array, but each entry is still a string.
  Use `RealNumber(...)` or `Integer(...)` to convert to native Sage numbers.

  (The first line just creates the file we will read in.)
code: |
  open('example-data.csv', 'w').write('age,size\n1,1.1\n3,6.33\n7,10\n2,3\n8,9\n5,4')

  import csv
  with open('example-data.csv') as csvfile:
      for line_num, row in enumerate(csv.reader(csvfile)):
          if line_num == 0:
              print(row)
          else:
              age = Integer(row[0])
              size = RealNumber(row[1])
              print(age, size)
