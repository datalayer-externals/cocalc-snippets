title: Introduction
descr: |
  This is a very simple example how to plot a function.

  For plots of symbolic functions you need to make sure, that $x$ is a symbolic variable.
  `x` is defined as such a variable by default, but you might have overwritten it.
  In such a case, `x = var('x')` redefines $x$ as such a symbolic variable with the name `"x"`.

  The second argument `(x, -10, 10)` defines the interval where to evaluate the symoblic expression.
  In this case here, it says to evaluate $x \in [-10, \, 10]$.

  x = var('x')
  plot(x * sin(x), (x, -10, 10))

title: Simple 2D Plot
code:  plot(2*x^2 - 3*x + 1, (x, -10, 10))
descr: Plot of $f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1$.

title: Cool 2D Plot
code:  plot(x * sin(x), (x, -10, 10))
descr: Plot of $f(x) = x \sin(x)$.

title: Simple 3D Plot
code:  |
    var('x y')
    plot3d(sin(x) * cos(y), (x, -10, 10), (y, -10, 10))
descr: 3D plot of $f(x,y) = \sin(x)\cos(y)$.
