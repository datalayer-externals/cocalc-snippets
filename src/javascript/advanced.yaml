title: "Async/Await in ijavascript"
desc: >
  This is how you can run async code in `ijavascript`.
  Notice, how there is a 1 second delay between the outputs and only then the execution halts (calling `$$.done()`)

  See [ijavascript async output](http://n-riesco.github.io/ijavascript/doc/async.ipynb.html) for more information.
code: |
  $$.async();

  console.log("Hello, World!");

  function run() {
      console.log("I'm done waiting a second.");
      $$.done();
  }

  setTimeout(run, 1000);
